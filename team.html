                <h3>Our Founder, Jane Doe</h3>
                <p>
                    A Harvard grad from humble beginnings, Jane started her career 
                    as an engineer for the powerhouse consulting firm Consulting & Consultants. 
                    She had long been dissatisfied with the lack of diversity throughout her 
                    educational journey and corporate line of work, but wasn't sure what 
                    she could do about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile during the pandemic, she developed a passion for baking 
                    and started to sell her creations as a hobby. With the business 
                    quickly expanding and Jane still working out of her kitchen, her mother 
                    and grandmother were roped into helping her run the business. With their 
                    support, Jane decided to leave her full-time job and pursue her new passion, 
                    dedicating her proceeds to helping underrepresented groups in STEM.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, Jane is still heavily involved in the company's foundation and philanthrophic 
                    efforts.
