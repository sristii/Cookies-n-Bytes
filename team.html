            <p>Here at Cookies & Bytes, we are proud to be a completely female-run small
                business. Learn more about our incredible team below: 
            </p> 
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Our Founder and Chair of Philanthropy, Sam Levine</h2>
            <div class="bio">
                <img class="photos" src="images/sam.jpeg" > 
                <p class ="sub-text">
                    A Harvard grad from humble beginnings, Sam started her career 
                    as an engineer for the powerhouse consulting firm Consulting & Consultants. 
                    However, she found her dissatisfied with the lack of diversity both throughout her 
                    educational journey and in her corporate line of work, but wasn't sure what 
                    she could do about it. 
                    <br><br>
                    Meanwhile during the pandemic, she developed a passion for baking 
                    and started to sell her creations as a hobby. The business 
                    picked up overnight, and Sristi was still working out of her kitchen when 
                    she decided to leave her full-time job and pursue her new passion. She vowed 
                    to use her growing platform for good, donating a part of her proceeds to help 
                    underrepresented groups in STEM starting from her very first sale.  <br><br>
                    Today, Sam is still heavily involved in the company's daily activities and 
                    leads our philanthrophic efforts.

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Our CEO, Jane Fatilli</h2>
            <div class="bio">
                <p class ="sub-text">
                    Joining us as CEO earlier this year, Jane has been a long standing and outspoken 
                    champion for equity in STEM. Since taking the helm in June, she has already 
                    kicked off several new initiatives and projects aimed at furthering our mission.  
                    <br><br>
                    Prior to Cookies & Bytes, Jane served as the CEO for companies such as Sodas & Software
                    and Hamburgers & Hardware. She has an impressive track record as a respected, 
                    results-driven executive leader. Jane's vision for the company includes innovation and 
                    international growth, all the while working closely with Sam to ensure our continued 
                    commitment to funding and promoting STEM education and accessibility.

                    <br><br>
                    Since then, Sarah has overseen everything from the website to the order 
                    supply chain management system connecting our kitchens to our delivery drivers. Prior 
                    to Cookies & Bytes, Sarah was Vice President of Development at Brownies & 
                    Bitcoin, where she led both the design and product teams. She plans to leverage her
