        <h1>Our Team</h1>
        <p>Here at Cookies & Bytes, we are proud to be a completely female-run small
            business. Learn more about our incredible team below:

                <h3>Our Founder and Chair of Philanthropy, Sristi Panchu</h3>
                <p>
                    A Harvard grad from humble beginnings, Sristi started her career 
                    as an engineer for the powerhouse consulting firm Consulting & Consultants. 
                    However, she found her dissatisfied with the lack of diversity both throughout her 
                    educational journey and in her corporate line of work, but wasn't sure what 
                    she could do about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile during the pandemic, she developed a passion for baking 
                    and started to sell her creations as a hobby. The business 
                    picked up overnight, and Sristi was still working out of her kitchen when 
                    she decided to leave her full-time job and pursue her new passion. She vowed 
                    to use her growing platform for good, donating a part of her proceeds to help 
                    underrepresented groups in STEM from her very first sale.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, Sristi is still heavily involved in the company's daily activities and 
                    leads our philanthrophic efforts.

                    international growth, all the while working closely with Sristi to ensure our continued
