                    I am immensely thankful to Cookies & Bytes for their dedication to supporting 
                    underrepresented individuals in STEM. The grant I received made a huge 
                    difference, helping me pursue my research dreams in the STEM field without worrying 
                    about financial constraints. Cookies & Bytes actively takes steps to make a 
                    positive impact in the lives of aspiring STEM enthusiasts, and I am truly honored to be 
                    a part of their community.

                    Cookies & Bytes has played a pivotal role in shaping my STEM journey. As a participant in 
                    their mentorship program, I can attest to the incredible impact they have had on my academic 
                    success. My mentor have been invaluable in providing me guidance, helping me navigate a STEM education
                    and answering all my questions at every turn. I am so grateful for the opportunities Cookies & Bytes 
                    have provided me and the network of similar students I can now turn to.

                    My experience with the Cookies & Bytes afterschool tutoring program has been nothing 
                    short of transformative. I attended the program every other day, and it made a profound 
                    positive impact on me and my academics. The tutors were incredibly kind, patient, 
                    and understanding. They really made sure I understood complex concepts, answered all my questions, 
                    and helped me review anything I was struggling in both my high school math and science classes. 
                    I am now pursuing a degree in astrophysics, something that I never thought could be possible for 
                    me.
