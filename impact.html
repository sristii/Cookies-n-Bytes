                        I am immensely thankful to Cookies & Bytes for their dedication to supporting 
                        underrepresented individuals in STEM. The grant I received made a huge 
                        difference, helping me pursue my research dreams in the STEM field without worrying 
                        about financial constraints. Cookies & Bytes actively takes steps to make a 
                        positive impact in the lives of aspiring STEM enthusiasts, and I am truly honored to be 
                        a part of their community.

                    Cookies & Bytes has played a pivotal role in shaping my STEM journey. As a participant in 
                    their mentorship program, I can attest to the incredible impact they have had on my academic 
                    success. My mentor have been invaluable in providing me guidance, helping me navigate a STEM education
                    and answering all my questions at every turn. I am so grateful for the opportunities Cookies & Bytes 
                    have provided me and the network of similar students I can now turn to.

                    My experience with the Cookies & Bytes afterschool tutoring program has been nothing 
                    short of transformative. I attended the program every other day, and it made a profound 
                    positive impact on me and my academics. The tutors were incredibly kind, patient, 
                    and understanding. They really made sure I understood complex concepts, answered all my questions, 
                    and helped me review anything I was struggling in both my high school math and science classes. 
                    I am now pursuing a degree in astrophysics, something that I never thought could be possible for 
                    me.

                    I'm currently attending Tufts University on a full scholarship thanks to the Cookies & Bytes
                    Leader's Scholarship. It has truly lifted an incredible weight off my shoulders and I will 
                    never find the words to express how much I appreciate it. I have been able to pursue my passions and research without any worries, and have been able to work with companies like 
                    Apple and Facebook because of the time I've been able to purely dedicate to my studies. 
                    Last but not least, I truly just love their cookies!
